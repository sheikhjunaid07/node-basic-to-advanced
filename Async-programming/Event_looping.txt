Event looping - Event looping is a process which explains how the processors are executed in Javascript environment. Consist of several parts like - Call Stack, Callback Queue, Web APIs etc.

Call Stack - It is stack of processors i.e. all the processers which are to be executed, must be placed in call stack, ones process execution is completed it will be removed from call stack.

Note:- As JS follows single call stack hence UNI-threded in nature.

Callback Queue - Those process which is to be executed, but are delayed due to aqdditional circumextences are in callback queue.
It checks call stack is empty or not.
If empty process will be transfered to call stack.
If not it will wait untill callstack will be empty.

WEB APIs - Third party supports like - setTimeout, DOM etc.
